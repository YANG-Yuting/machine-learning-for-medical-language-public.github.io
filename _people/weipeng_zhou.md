Weipeng Zhou is a Medical Informatics Ph.D. student (supervised by Meliha Yestigen) at the University of Washington. Weipengâ€™s work operates at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and healthcare data. He studies pretraining and fine-tuning (large) language models for domain-specific tasks, such as the classification of clinical note sections. On the clinical application side, he also facilitates the understanding of clinical problems by applying NLP methods to extract symptoms from clinical notes. He studies the progression of symptoms prior to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and tries to identify Long COVID patients from the general population for better healthcare delivery. Weipeng enjoys collaborating with researchers from various fields. He worked on public health problems and developed a tool for gathering areal neighborhood measures, such as education status and commuting methods. Outside UW, he also interned at Boston Children's Hospital in the summers of 2022 and 2023 under the supervision of Timothy A. Miller.
